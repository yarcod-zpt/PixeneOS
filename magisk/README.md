## Info

Only unofficial [pixincreate/Magisk](https://github.com/pixincreate/Magisk) is supported as [Official Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) is not supported by GrapheneOS.
The chances of Root not working are high, let alone Zygisk.

For detailed explanation, refer [README](https://github.com/pixincreate/PixeneOS#root)
